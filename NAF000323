Once Kauha's wives were ǂnǂdwa bushes. They were doing what women do, but they were ǂnǂdwa bushes. They were looking for a way to get back at their husband. When he happened to come near the ǂnǂdwa patch, the bushes jumped on him and beat him. They pounded him and hit him over the head. He had just been walking along and suddenly the bushes were cracking his head open.
Kauha finally got the bushes quieted down, and he stood them back up in the sand so that they were just regular ǂnǂdwa again. Then he went into the center of the patch, "Here is a lot of ripe ǂnǂdwa!" he called out to his wives. "Come on and eat it with me!" When the wives came running and had come into the midst of the bushes, he made the bushes begin to beat them. The ǂnǂdwa beat them until they cried and ran away.

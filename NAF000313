The python was the wife of the kori bustard. The kori bustard had married the python. The jackal was the python's younger sister.
The two sisters went to the waterhole, to the spring, and the jackal said to the python, "Climb up the tree. Let's eat these n«Ça fruits hanging here." So the python climbed the tree, climbed up into the small branches, and the branches broke with her weight. She fell into the spring. Then the jackal said "Ha! Now I'll go steal her husband away from her." The python was left at the bottom of the spring. She just lay there.
The jackal picked up the python's things, her clothing and ornaments, and put them on. She hung them on herself and tried them this way and that. In the late afternoon she returned to the kori bustard's camp. She went home and went to sit in the python's house.
Soon the python's husband came home from the bush, "Where's my wife?" he said to himself. "Who is this sitting here instead? Why don't I see my wife today, now that I've come home? Where has my wife gone today? What's happened?" Night began to fall. They all sat around and talked and talked. When it was dark, the kori bustard took arrows and stood them up in the sand. He stood them in rows with the tips pointing upwards. When the jackal went to bed she lay down on top of them. And so she died. When dawn broke, the husband left and went away. He was changed into a kori bustard. And the jackal became a jackal.

God [[Thora]] in olden days sent this message to men by the mouth of the chameleon, "Oh, men, you will all die, but you will rise again." Now the chameleon was slow, and forgot the message, so he turned back to God [to ask Him]. God was angry -and called the hare, and said, "You are a quick runner; take this message to men, 'Oh, mien, you will all die, but you will rise again."' Now the hare forgot, .and changed the message into "Oh, men, you will all die, but you will die for ever." The men were so angry that one lifted a stone and struck the hare, and split her lip, so the bare has always a cleft lip. The tale is ended.

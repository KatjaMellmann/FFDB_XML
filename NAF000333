It was a woman who first found fire. Her husband didn't have any. So she and the small children ate good things but her husband ate raw things. They all ate cooked things and the man ate raw things.
But one day he made a jani toy and flew it and it led him to fire. He ran and threw the jani and where it fell he followed. He ran and ran past the others and stole the fire and now men, as well as women, have fire.
At first, people had no water. The elephant discovered some, and drank it. He knew where it was, and he was drinking it. But his wife and her people lived in thirst. The elephant alone had water to drink. He would drink and then go eat for awhile, then return to eat again. Everyone else went to bed thirsty every night: the elephant was the only one who was drinking water.
One day, though, the others stole the water from the elephant. It was the little rainbirds who stole it.

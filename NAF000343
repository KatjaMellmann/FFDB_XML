This is the story of the moon and the hare. The moon said to the hare, "Hey! Let it be that when a person dies, he'll live again. He won't just die: he'll come back to life."
The hare answered "No. When a person dies he will smell bad. And he will never get up again."
The moon asked him "And what about you, the hare, if you die: don't you think you will get up again?"
"Yes, even if I die I don't think I'll ever get up again," said the hare.
So they began to argue, and to fight. The moon took a shoe and struck the hare's upper lip. Then they separated. The hare went one way, the moon went the other, into the east. The moon became the moon, and hung in the sky. The hare became an animal. And they were separate from then on.

The moon said to the hare, "When a person dies, he will go away for awhile and then return,"
And the hare said "No, I don't like that idea. How could a person who comes back from the dead possibly smell good?" That's what the hare said.
But the moon had said a dead person would smell good when he returned. He said that if a person died he would come back to life. Like the moon he would die but return again as the moon did when the people in the west threw his shoulderblade back to the east and he came to life again. That's what the moon said, that when a person died he would go away and return. He would return, would return to his own people.
But the hare said "A person will just die and not return!"
The moon again refused and said "Corpses will smell good after death. Dead men will die and then return, as I do." That's what the moon does, dies and then swells again and hangs in the sky. You've seen him yourself.
The moon's words were good but the hare spoke badly. The moon keeps his word and always returns when we think he has died. But the hare with the split mouth is surely a terrible thing. That day the hare scratched the moon's face with his claws. And the moon took an axe and chopped the hare's lip until it split. Yes, that little hare is bad.

My younger brother-in-law,
Put my head in the fire. [[When the "Knorhaan Brandkop" was still a man, his head was thrust into the fire by his brother-in-law, in order to punish him for having surreptitiously married a sister. Since then he is only a bustard.]] 
My younger brother-in-law,
My younger brother-in-law,
Put my head in the fire.

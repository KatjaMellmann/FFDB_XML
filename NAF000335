ǁgauwa took his children and hid them somewhere. Then he went to tell the ostrich he had killed them, so that the ostrich would kill his own children. Now, the ostrich was a person at that time. "Yo!" he said, when he realized what had happened. "What has this guy done to me? Why has he put his own children off safely somewhere and then convinced me to kill my children?"
When ǁgauwa went to fetch water, the ostrich sat in the path from the waterhole to the camp. He crossed his long legs, obstructing the road, and waited for ǁgauwa to come by with the water pots he was carrying on a yoke. When ǁgauwa came up to him, he said to the ostrich, "You piece of filth, get out of the way and let me pass. What do you think you're doing?"
Then the ostrich got up, saying to himself, "What am I going to do to this guy? What kind of business is it if he kills all my children and his own children stay alive?"
So he lay down again and crossed his legs across the path, ǁgauwa stepped forward. The ostrich said, "What do you think you're doing, treating me like that? What is this, anyway?" Then the two of them began to fight, "tshxa-tshxa!" They grabbed at each other, and chased each other around. Then they ran to a rock, and ǁgauwa squeezed into an opening in the rock. The ostrich grabbed his testicles and pulled! ǁgauwa cried out "No! Go around up front there and catch me as I come out!" So the ostrich ran around to the front of the rock. While he was waiting for ǁgauwa to come out, the rock snapped together with ǁgauwa still inside. The ostrich waited a long time but nothing happened. Then he began to kick the rock. He kicked so hard that he broke his feet. Finally he gave up and went home.
